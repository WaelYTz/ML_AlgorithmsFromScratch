# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch** repository! This project contains foundational machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, focusing on building these models from the ground up to better understand their mechanics.

## Project Overview

This repository currently includes implementations of linear regression and logistic regression. Building these from scratch helps develop an understanding of the mathematical concepts and coding techniques needed to create and optimize models.

## Algorithms Included

- **Linear Regression**: Implemented using gradient descent to minimize the cost function for regression tasks.
- **Logistic Regression**: A binary classification algorithm using sigmoid activation and cross-entropy loss.

## Project Structure

- **/algorithms**: Contains implementations of each algorithm.
- **/datasets**: Sample datasets used to test the algorithms.
- **/notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks to explore each algorithm interactively.
